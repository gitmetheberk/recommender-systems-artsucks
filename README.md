# CSCE 489 Art Recommender

### Bringing Art to the Modern Engineering Student

_Aggies Recommending Truly Stylish Unique Curated Kitschy Stuff_ (ART SUCKS) is a web based art browsing tool which aims to help artistically deprived engineering students gain a deeper appreciation for artwork by presenting humanity's greatest works of all time in a comfortable, familiar format. 

## How it works

The ART SUCKS recommender is an ensemble recommender system which uses both Content- and Temporally-based methods to recommend images to the user. 

### Frontend

The frontend will be built using Django templates and whatever else we need to throw in there.

### Backend

The backend will be built on Django. We plan to use [this template](https://github.com/jpadilla/django-project-template) as a starting point.

### Hosting

The site will be hosted using DigitalOcean's free $100 credit/2 month trial.

### Feature generation

This will be done with some magic function involving CNNs.
